# Portfolio-Page

## Description

This project is meant to be a portfolio page featuring my one complete project and four additional placeholders for future projects. A portfolio page can be extremely useful if you want to display all of your work to someone, usually a potential employer. My motivation for this is to showcase my skills and progress to employers after bootcamp to land a job. This keeps all of my projects centralized and organized to make it easy for people to veiw my work without having to access many files individually. The website's interactivity will bring the user directly to each project while at the same time showing how I was able to use CSS to build the portfolio page itself. I learned a lot about CSS properties in this project, mostly through my struggle to properly use the flex property I was able to grasp a much better understanding of its real world use and how to properly apply it.
